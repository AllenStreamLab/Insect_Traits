# Insect_Traits

Models were used to assess trait-environment relationships for benthic macroinvertebrate in the contiguous United States. This work is published at Ecography (Kopp and Allen 2020).  All models were fit using the models.r and all plots were created using the plotting.r. Supporting functions are contained  in supporting_functions.r and were used for model evaluation and probability calculations.  All data used for this project is publicly available and obtained from the national rivers and streams assessment and the USEPA traits database.  DisturbanceIntercepts are the Bayesian mixed effects models. Random forest objects for each trait-state are saved as rf_XXX_optimized. The traits data for NRSA sites are contained in traitsdata.csv.
